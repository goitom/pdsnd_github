### Exploratory Analysis of Bikeshare Data for Three Cities


### Description
This project allows the user to interactively explore bikeshare data from three cities (Chicago, New York, Washington D.C.). The user is prompted to select a city and either observations filtered by a particular month, or from all months in the dataset. The user is then presented with summary statistics, and allowed to view a slice of the raw data if they so choose.
